# Bash--Bunny

Hey there! So, I've been really interested in the Bash Bunny by Hak5, but I have to admit, it's quite pricey. Determined to find an alternative solution, I started scouring the internet for some smarter folks who might have come up with something similar. That's when I stumbled upon a webpage by a guy named Alex Jensen. He shared his DIY approach to creating a budget-friendly version of the Bash Bunny. If you're interested, you can check out his page here: https://www.cron.dk/poor-mans-bash-bunny/

From what I gathered, Alex Jensen's page, which dates back to 2018, offers insights into building it. But not as much as I hoped I am not the smartest person but I wanted to take on the challenge to build off of what hak5 and Alex Jensen did so this is what I have so far. I am building a PCB to make it easier for all

Updates are coming
